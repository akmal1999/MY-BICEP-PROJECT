Evaluation Project: Bicep
Objective

This project is built based "Evaluation Project: Bicep Objective Establish a secure and scalable Azure environment tailored for a web application hosted on a Virtual Machine (VM), ensuring high availability, automated deployment, security, and monitoring. The setup must use Bicep for infrastructure definition and include both an Azure SQL Database and a Storage Account, with configurations and deployment processes documented and pushed to a public GitHub repository."

Project Info.

This project is modularized for future expansion and to templatize and organize for future usage. The modules folder contains subfolders for each logical grouping of resources (like network, compute, data, and core). This makes it easier to manage and understand the relationships between resources. A parameters folder is used to store environment-specific parameter files, allowing for easy switching between different configurations (e.g., development, testing, production).

Best Practices:

Version Control: Keep your Bicep files and CI/CD definitions under version control to track changes and maintain a history of your infrastructure configuration.

Security: Store sensitive information like Azure service principal credentials securely in GitHub Secrets or Azure DevOps secure files/variables. Ensure that access to these secrets is tightly controlled.

Modularity: Use modular Bicep files for different Azure resources to make your infrastructure code easier to understand, maintain, and reuse across projects or environments.

Parameterization: Utilize parameter files to customize deployments for different environments, making your IaC setup flexible and scalable.

This structured approach not only keeps your project organized but also aligns with best practices for infrastructure as code development, ensuring deployments are maintainable, scalable, and secure.



Key Elements of the Repository Structure:

.github/workflows or azure-pipelines.yml: These files define your CI/CD pipeline configuration, depending on whether you're using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps. They contain the steps to install necessary tools, authenticate to Azure, and deploy your Bicep templates.

main.bicep: This is the primary Bicep file that orchestrates the deployment of all resources defined in the modules directory. It references the modular Bicep files and passes parameters to them as necessary.

modules: This directory is organized by resource category (e.g., compute, core, data, network) and contains the Bicep modules for each specific Azure resource you're deploying. This modular approach helps keep your infrastructure code organized and reusable.

parameters: Contains environment-specific parameter files, like dev.parameters.json, which provide values for the parameters expected by your Bicep files during deployment. This allows for easy customization of deployments across different environments (e.g., development, testing, production).
